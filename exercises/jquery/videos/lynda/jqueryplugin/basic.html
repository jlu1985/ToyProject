					uncompressed copies of jQuery files are available. The uncompressed
					file is best used during development or debugging; the compressed
					file saves bandwidth and improves performance in production. You
					can also download a sourcemap file for use when debugging with a
					compressed file. The map file is not required for users to run
					jQuery, it just improves the developer's debugger experience. As of
					jQuery 1.11.0/2.1.0 the //# sourceMappingURL comment is not
					included in the compressed file.</div></li>
			<li><div class="panel">jQuery 1.x The jQuery 1.x line had

					been updated. Read the jQuery 1.9 Upgrade Guide and the jQuery 1.9
					release blog post for more information. Download the compressed,

					well. Since IE 8 is still relatively common, we recommend using the
					1.x version unless you are certain no IE 6/7/8 users are visiting
					the site. Please read the 2.0 release notes carefully. Download the
